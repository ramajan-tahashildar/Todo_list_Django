# Todo_list_Django
 The Django-based Todo List project allows users to manage tasks through a web interface. This project demonstrates key Django features such as models, views, templates, and forms to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. It also integrates user authentication, ensuring tasks are personal to each logged-in user.
